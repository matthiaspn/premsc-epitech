                <h4>Story</h4>
                <p>Before entering pre-Msc, I spent two years in the Epitech graduate program on the Lille campus.
                    I was able to realize a first internship within the company Eiffage Construction, one of the
                    companies of the group Eiffage, where I realized a tool allowing to make accessible digital models
                    for the personnel supervising the building sites of the company. This internship led to a work-study
                    in the IT department of the group in Paris. During my second year, I also have my own activity as
                    an auto-entrepreneur in web and mobile development: Today, I have more than ten major clients and
                    I teach at the ISEG school of communication and marketing in Lille.</p>
